# is-a.dev Domain Registration Instructions

To register your domain `sinaaanck.is-a.dev`, follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Go to [https://github.com/is-a-dev/register](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register) and click "Fork".
2.  **Create Files**: In your forked repository, create the following files (or upload the ones I created for you in the `is-a-dev-submission` folder):

    *   **File 1**: `domains/sinaaanck.json`
        *   Content: Copy from `is-a-dev-submission/sinaaanck.json`

    *   **File 2**: `domains/_vercel.sinaaanck.json`
        *   Content: Copy from `is-a-dev-submission/_vercel.sinaaanck.json`

3.  **Create Pull Request**: Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in the original `is-a-dev/register` repository and create a new Pull Request from your fork.
4.  **Wait**: Wait for the maintainers to merge your PR. Join their Discord if you want to speed it up.

**Note**: I have used the standard Vercel A record IP (`76.76.21.21`) in the configuration file, which is generally recommended over the specific IP you found, unless Vercel explicitly told you otherwise for your specific project.
